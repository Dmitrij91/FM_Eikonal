Fast Marching Algorithm for Solving the Eikonal Equation on Weighted Graphs

This repository contains an implementation of the **Fast Marching Algorithm (FMA)** for solving the Eikonal equation on weighted graphs. The algorithm leverages a **binary heap** data structure to accelerate the wavefront propagation, ensuring optimal performance in terms of computational complexity. The implementation is based on the foundational work presented in the following paper:

## Algorithm Overview
The **Fast Marching Algorithm** is a numerical method designed to efficiently solve the Eikonal equation on weighted graphs, where the goal is to compute the shortest path (or minimal cost) from a source node to all other nodes in the graph. By adapting the geometric diffusion process to graph structures, this implementation is capable of handling both local and non-local data processing tasks, making it highly versatile.

### Binary Heap Acceleration
To optimize performance, this implementation uses a **binary heap** to maintain and update the active front of the wave propagation. The binary heap helps manage the node processing order in a way similar to Dijkstra's algorithm, ensuring that nodes are processed in order of increasing distance (or cost).

- **Binary Heap Operations**: 
  - The heap ensures that retrieving the next node with the smallest distance (or time) is done in **O(log N)** time, where **N** is the number of nodes in the heap.
  - When a node's distance is updated, the heap is efficiently re-ordered, minimizing the computational cost of maintaining the wavefront.
  
By leveraging the binary heap, the algorithm achieves an optimal time complexity of **O(N log N)**, where **N** is the number of nodes in the graph. This makes the algorithm highly scalable, even for large graphs and datasets.

## Applications
The Fast Marching Algorithm with binary heap acceleration is highly suited for a wide range of image and data processing tasks, including:

1. **Syntactic Data Processing**: Analyze complex graph structures, such as social networks, syntax trees, or molecular graphs, by efficiently computing distances or shortest paths.
2. **Centerline Detection in Tubular Structures**: Detect the centerlines of tubular objects in 2D or 3D images (e.g., blood vessels, airways) by simulating wave propagation along the geometric structures.
3. **Distance Mapping**: Generate distance or geodesic maps from a source point to all other nodes in the graph, useful for image segmentation, shape analysis, or feature extraction in high-dimensional data.

## Features
- **Binary Heap Acceleration**: The use of a binary heap ensures efficient propagation of wavefronts and minimization of computation time.
- **Flexible Graph Structures**: The algorithm can be applied to both local and non-local graphs, allowing it to process diverse types of data such as images, point clouds, or network graphs.
- **Scalability**: The binary heap's logarithmic time complexity makes the implementation suitable for large datasets and graphs.
